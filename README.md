# Crowd Counting Project

## Project Overview
This project uses computer vision techniques to estimate the number of people in crowded environments accurately. Crowd counting has numerous applications in real-world scenarios such as monitoring public events, ensuring safety in large gatherings, analyzing foot traffic in retail, and even managing social distancing during pandemics.

The system uses deep learning models to count the number of individuals in an image or a video stream, especially in crowded scenes where manual counting would be difficult and inaccurate.
